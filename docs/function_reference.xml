<para>CMView can import two general classes of data files: </para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Tertiary structure files</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Contact map files</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>For tertiary structure files (e.g. PDB files), a contact map will be calculated from the 3D coordinates using the user specified contact type and distance cutoff, the structure will be automatically loaded into PyMol and the 3D visualization features will be available.</para>
<para>For contact map files, only the main contact map window will be available.</para>
<para>CMView contact map files are special in the sense that they store the PDB code of the structure they were derived from (if applicable). When opening a .cm file, the application then tries to retrieve the 3D coordinates from the online PDB.</para><sect4><title>Load from online PDB</title>
<para>Loads a structure from the PDB ftp site. The file is downloaded in mmCIF format and cached locally.</para></sect4><sect4><title>Load from PDB file</title>
<para>Loads a structure from a local PDB file. The file needs to contain an initial HEADER line and one or more ATOM lines following the PDB file specification [1]. Alternatively, files may also follow the Casp tertiary structure prediction format [2].</para>

<para>Closes all windows and exits CMView.</para></sect3></sect2><sect2><title>View</title><sect3><title>Show PDB residue numbers</title>
<para>Shows or hides display of classic residue numbers as found in PDB text files.</para>
<para>It is not uncommon to find residue numbers in PDB text files which are non-sequential, negative, starting from a very high number, contain insertion codes etc. This creates many problems in data processing. Whenever possible, CMView therefore uses residue numbers following the full protein sequence. This numbering is now provided for all PDB entries in mmCIF files. For comparison with pdb text files it may be desirable to know the classic number of a particular residue. When this option is selected, the classic numbers are shown in the status corner below the secondary structure annotation.</para></sect3><sect3><title>Show rulers</title>
<para>Shows/hides the rulers at the top and left end of the contact maps. The rulers are used to display the secondary structure annotation if available and to allow selections based on residues and secondary structure elements.</para></sect3><sect3><title>Show icon bar</title>
<para>Shows/hides the icon bar above the contact map.</para></sect3><sect3><title>Show common neighborhood sizes*</title>
<para>Displays/hides an information overlay showing the common neighborhood size for each residue pair.</para>
<para>The common neighborhood of residue pair (i,j) is the set of residues in contact with both i and j. Common neighborhood sizes are shown as colors in the contacts map where darker colors indicate larger common neighborhoods. Pairs which are in contact are shown in shades of purple, those which are not in contact as shades of green.</para></sect3><sect3><title>Show contact density*</title>
<para>Displays/hides the contact density map.</para>
<para>The contact density map shows for every residue pair (i,j) the density of contacts within the backbone fragment ranging from i to j. The density is defined as the number of contacts within the fragment normalized by the average number of contacts over all fragments of the same size. High densities are shown in red, low densities are shown in blue. To smooth the data, contacts between sequence neighbors are added if they are not present (e.g. because a sequence separation filter &gt; 1 was used when creating the contact map).</para>
<para>High-density regions often coincide with structural units like domains, secondary- and super-secondary structure elements.</para></sect3><sect3><title>Show distance map*</title>
<para>Displays/hides a distance map showing all pairwise distances between residues.</para>
<para>Distances are visualized as colors. The color coding depends on the distance cutoff of the current contact map. Distances above the cutoff are shown in blue, distances around the cutoff are shown in green and distances below the cutoff are shown in red, where the darkest blue is the longest distance and the darkest red is the shortest distance. Distances are calculated between C-alpha atoms.</para>
<para>The distance map can only be shown if 3D coordinates for the structure are available.</para></sect3></sect2><sect2><title>Select</title><sect3><title>Selection modes </title>

<para>Visualizes the currently selected contacts as edges in the 3D viewer. The edges are drawn between the C-alpha atoms of the residues in contact.</para>
<para>In single contact map mode, two selection object are created in the 3D viewer:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The set of contacts (drawn as solid yellow lines)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The set of residues participating in one of the contacts</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>These selection objects can be manipulated directly in the 3D viewer, for example to change colors or to display side-chain atoms.</para>
<para>In comparison mode, six contact objects and the corresponding residue selections are created:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Contacts in structure A which are present in both structures – drawn as solid yellow lines</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Contacts in structure B which are present in both structures – drawn as solid yellow lines</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Contacts in structure A which are present only in structure A – drawn as solid pink lines</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Contacts in structure B which are present only in structure B – drawn as solid green lines</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Pseudo-contacts in structure A (present in B but absent in A) – drawn as dashed pink lines</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Pseudo-contacts in structure B (present in A but absent in B) – drawn as dashed green lines</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>Pseudo-contacts means that the distance between the two residues is above the defined distance cutoff. They are shown to allow easier analysis of conformational changes, where contacts have been lost or new contacts have been established.</para>
<para>Note: In PyMol 1.00 and above, above selections will be grouped together for a better overview. Earlier versions of PyMol do not support this feature.</para></sect3><sect3><title>Delete selected contacts*</title>
<para>Permanently deletes the currently selected contacts from the contact map. </para></sect3></sect2><sect2><title>Compare</title><sect3><title>Load second contact map</title>
<para>TODO: Rename menu item</para>
<para>Loads a second contact map (in the following called B) to compare it to the currently open one (A). For the different input files see Load from (TODO: add link)</para>
<para>After a second contact map has been loaded, contacts are shown with the following color coding:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Black: contacts present in both structure A and structure B</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Pink: contacts present in contact map A but absent in B</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Green: contacts present in structure B but absent in A</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>To overlay the contact maps, an alignment between the residue of A and B needs to be defined. CMView offers the following options to obtain an alignment:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment</para>
<para>Calculates a global sequence alignment using the classic Needleman-Wunsch-Gotoh algorithm with standard parameters (Matrix: BLOSSUM50, Gap-open: 10, Gap-extend: 0.5). The JAligner package [1] is used for the calculation.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Maximum contact map overlap structural alignment</para>
<para>Calculates a structure based alignment using the SADP algorithm [2]. It applies a very fast heuristic to maximize the contact map overlap between two structures. The algorithm is particularly well suited for aligning contact maps since it can be applied even if no exact 3D coordinates are available.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Load alignment from FASTA file</para>
<para>Loads an alignment from a text file in FASTA alignment format. This format can be exported by many standard sequence alignment programs (e.g. Muscle, T-Coffee, EMBOSS, Bioperl).</para>

<para>Displays/hides the difference distance map of the two structures.</para>
<para>The difference distance map is a powerful tool to visualize conformational changes between two protein structures. For a pair of residues (i,j) the distance map visualizes how much the distance between i and j has changed from one structure to the other. This highlights regions of conformational change as red hotspots while regions which remain unchanged appear in blue.</para>
<para>For each pair of residues, the absolute difference between the distance in structure A and the distance in structure B.</para>
<para>The difference map can only be shown if 3D coordinates for both structures are available.</para></sect3><sect3><title>Superimpose from selection</title>
<para>Superimposes the structures in the 3D viewer based on the currently selected contacts.</para>
<para>When two structure are loaded for comparison, they are initially superimposed using an all-residue C-alpha minimum RMSD fit. In such a rigid-body superimposition, some regions may not align well in 3D. This feature allows to select a region of interest and to perform a minimum-RMSD fit only based on the residues participating in the contact selection. </para>
<para>Note: When changing the orientation of structures in PyMol (e.g. using the custom superposition function), earlier contact objects are not moved with the original structure. There is currently no workaround for this.</para></sect3><sect3><title>Show corresponding residues from selection</title>
<para>(TODO: Merge with above?)</para>
<para>Visualizes aligned residues in the 3D viewer.</para>
<para>To highlights the correspondence between residues in structure A and structure B, lines are drawn between corresponding residues. This gives a visual three dimensional impression of the underlying alignment.</para></sect3></sect2><sect2><title>Help</title><sect3><title>Help </title>
