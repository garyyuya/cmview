        <para>CMView is an interactive Contact Map viewer for protein 
    structures. CMView will allow you to display the contact map and 
    interact with it as well as to show features of the contact map in 
    the corresponding 3-dimensional structure by using the PyMol 
    molecular viewer.</para>

        <title>Loading a Contact Map/Structure</title>

        <para>The first step to get your contact map on screen is to 
        load it by using Load from from the File menu. Here there are 
        many options for the source of your data:</para>

        <orderedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>Online PDB which will download the PDB data for your 
            chosen 4 letter PDB code directly from the Protein Data 
            Bank&apos;s web</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>PDB File, if what you have is a model output of a 
            molecular modeling program in PDB format, then choose this 
            option to load your data</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>CASP RR File, to load CASP residue-residue contact 
            predictions. You can also save files with this format with 
            Save to-&gt; CASP RR File</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Contact Map File refers to CMView&apos;s own format, 
            you can choose this if you previously saved a file from 
            CMView in this format.</para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        <para>For this example we will load from Online PDB the PDB 
        entry 1bxy, with chain code A. In the load dialog</para>

        <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/load_dialog.png" width=""/></para>

        <para>we can then choose the contact type and distance cutoff: 
        we take Ca (for C-alpha) and 8.0 Å as cutoff. After clicking OK the 
        contact map is displayed and the 3D structure is loaded to the 
        PyMol molecular viewer:</para>

        <title>Working with the Contact Map</title>

        <para>Some useful things you can do once your contact map has 
        been loaded are:</para>

        <orderedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>Select contacts: rectangle select, fill select, 
            diagonal select. While on diagonal mode the sequence 
            separation will be shown together with the coordinates in 
            the lower left corner.</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Show the distance map overlaid (View menu). You can 
            still select contacts while the distance map is shown</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Click on the Info &lt;icon&gt; button to get a full 
            report on the contact map: number of contacts, sequence 
            etc.</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>The top and left rulers show the color coded 
            secondary structure elements: blue for alpha-helix, red for 
            beta-sheet, green for turns. You can select contacts between 2 
            secondary structure elements by first clicking on the first 
            element in the top ruler and then on the second element on 
            the left ruler. You will get something like:</para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        <para><inlinegraphic fileref="" width=""/></para>

        <orderedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>Some other useful selections for secondary structure 
            elements can also be done from the View menu: helix-helix 
            contacts, strand-strand and intra/inter secondary structure 
            elements contacts.</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Select neighborhoods, i.e. all the contacts for a 
            given residue. Just choose the Neighborhood Selection Mode 
            and click on the ruler: all neighbors of the chosen residue 
            will be selected. If you click instead on the contact map 
            you will get the neighbors for the 2 residues of the 
            clicked residue pair. For instance if you click on cell 
            (26,43) one gets all neighbors of residue 26 and all 
            neighbors of residue 43. Here we present this in the 
            contact map view, in a graph representation and in the 
            3-dimensional structure:</para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        <para><inlinegraphic fileref="" width=""/></para>

        <para>At any time while navigating around the contact map or 
        the residue rulers you will always be able to see the contact 
        map coordinates of the current contact or residue: residue 
        number, residue type and secondary structure. You can also view 
        the original author assigned PDB residue numbers if you switch 
        the appropriate option on in the View menu (only if structure 
        was loaded from Online PDB).</para>

        <para>Remember in all selections above, you can always use 
        CTRL+click to add to the current selection.</para>

        <title>Interacting with PyMol</title>

        <para>Here is where CMView becomes most useful. After selecting 
        residue/contacts in the contact map we can then view their 
        correspondence on the 3-dimensional protein structure by using 
        the PyMol molecular viewer. Commands are sent directly and 
        interactively to PyMol. There are two functions:</para>

        <orderedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>Show selected contacts in 3D: will show the selected 
            contacts as distance objects between the C-alpha atoms of the 2 
            residues part of the contact. As well as the distance 
            object a selection is created in PyMol which contains all 
            residues present in the contact selection.</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Show residue pair as edge in 3D (available from the 
            context menu): will show the distance between the current 
            (where you right-clicked) pair of residues as a distance 
            object in PyMol.</para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        <para>As an example here we show contacts between secondary 
        structures element for our structure1bxy. Corresponding to each 
        function in the Select menu we have: a,b) helix-helix contacts, 
        c,d) strand-strand contacts, e,f) contacts within SS elements 
        and finally g,h) contacts between SS elements.</para>

        <para><inlinegraphic fileref="" width=""/></para>

        <para>Of course PyMol still works as usual so that it is 
        possible to do other things with the selections: highlighting 
        or showing different representations like sticks, spheres 
        etc.</para>

      <title>Comparing two contact maps</title>

      <sect2>

        <title>Loading the second contact map. Alignments.</title>

        <para>As an interesting example for the contact map comparison 
        feature we will use a CASP7 prediction. We want to compare the 
        target T0354 to a good prediction. So first we load the real 
        structure from the PDB file (same procedure as before) &lt;link 
        to the file&gt; and then the prediction &lt;link to the 
        file&gt; by using Compare -&gt; Load Second Structure From 
        -&gt; PDB File. As before we choose Ca as contact type and 8.0 
        Å distance cutoff.</para>

        <para>After pressing OK the second contact map is calculated 
        and a dialog comes up to choose what type of alignment we 
        want:</para>

        <para><inlinegraphic fileref="" width=""/></para>

        <para>For this case we have two structures with the same 
        sequence so we can simply select Needleman-Wunsch which will do 
        the trivial alignment. The second contact map is displayed and 
        at the same time the corresponding structure is loaded to PyMol 
        superimposed to the first structure:</para>

        <para><inlinegraphic fileref="" width=""/></para>

        <para />

        <para>CMView offers here also a structural alignment (SADP) 
        based on maximum contact map overlap that would be useful when 
        we have distant sequences. See CMView&apos;s full reference 
        &lt;link&gt; for more info about SADP. As a last alternative 
        you can also load in your own alignment from a FASTA 
        file.</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2>

        <title>Comparing</title>

        <para>The pairwise comparison mode shows the two contact maps 
        with contacts in 3 colors:</para>

        <orderedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>black for common contacts</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>pink for contacts unique to the first structure (the 
            real structure)</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>green for contacts unique to the second structure 
            (the prediction)</para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        <para>For our example of prediction against real this allows us 
        to see at a glance over-predicted (pink) and under-predicted 
        contacts (green).</para>

        <para>It is possible to switch between displaying each of the 
        sets with the toggle buttons &lt;icons&gt; in the tool bar. 
        Selections always refer to the currently displayed set.</para>

        <para>As in single mode above, the coordinates are displayed in 
        the lower left corner this time for the two structures. The 
        Info &lt;icon&gt; function will also display now information 
        for both structures including the numbers of common contacts 
        and unique contacts to each structure.</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2>

        <title>Interacting with PyMol</title>

        <para>Finally as before we can also interactively send contacts 
        to PyMol. In the pairwise case it gets more interesting because 
        we get a clear comparison of contacts made/not made by the two 
        structures. We will get now yellow edges in both structures for 
        the common contacts, pink edges for the contacts only in the 
        first structure and green edges for contacts only in the second 
        structure. Correspondingly dashed pink/green edges will be 
        displayed representing the absent (not-made) contacts in the 
        opposite structures.</para>

        <para>As an example we select the green contacts within the red 
        rectangle in b) below. For clarity we have separated the two 
        structures and highlighted residues with colors and spheres in 
        PyMol: c) contacts present in the second structure with solid 
        green edges, a) matching (from alignment) contacts absent in 
        the second structure, dashed pink edges.</para>

        <para><inlinegraphic fileref="" width=""/></para>

        <para>Two extra functions are available in the pairwise 
        comparison mode:</para>

        <orderedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>Superimpose from Selection will superimpose the two 
            structures in PyMol doing a best fit of residues from the 
            selected contacts.</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Show Corresponding Residues From Selection will show 
            the alignment matching pairs for the contacts 
            selected.</para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

      </sect2>
