Developer's notes
-----------------

Development tools:
- Eclipse 3.5.2
- Subclipse 1.5.3 (Eclipse SVN client)
- Docbook (see dependencies in docs/docbook/README)

Build process:
- Previously the custom script make-cmview-onejar.sh was used to build the jar file
- Now we use the Eclipse function 'File->Export->Java->Runnable jar file'
- Previously, the java help needs to be updated from the docbook sources
- Afterwards, the script package_for_distribution.sh can be used to make the downloadable zip file

Bug tracker:
- Currently, there is no real online bugtracker
- Previously, we have used an internal Twiki page and a temporary bugtracker on Google Docs
